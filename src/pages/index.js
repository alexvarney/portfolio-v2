              Iâ€™m Alex, a web developer from Waterloo, Ontario, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I build

              Iâ€™ve been writing code for almost 10 years and have been building
              websites for nearly 5. When Iâ€™m not working I like to play games,
              take photos and attend concerts shows.
